# Supported training dataset types are : LibriSpeech and Shtooka

# max_input_seq_length is the maximum number of 0.01s chunks we allow in a single training (or test) example
#   Recommended : 2000 chuncks (for 20 seconds) but it require more than 8 Gb of memory
# max_target_seq_length is the maximum number of letters we allow in a single training (or test) example output
#   Must be less than 65535 (int16 for reduced memory consumption)
#   Recommended : 400 characters (for 20 seconds seems reasonnable in most languages)
# Warnings :
#  - Those two values need to be consistent one with the other
#  - These values depends on your dataset used for training
# Small config (8 Gb memory) :
#  - use 800 / 250 respectively
#  - remove wav files over this limit from the dataset
#     (CAREFULL recursive delete : find -name *.wav -size +250k -exec rm {} \;)
