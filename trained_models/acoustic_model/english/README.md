# English pre-trained model

This directory contain a trained english acoustic model (53.000 steps of 10 files batches).

__Warning :__ This model use 3 layers, default is 2 in config file

Results on LibriSpeech's test-clean evaluation set :
* __CER : 21,3 %__
* __WER : 56,2 %__


### Dataset

The dataset was built using [Shtooka](http://shtooka.net/), [LibriSpeech](http://www.openslr.org/12/) and 
[TED-LIUM](http://www-lium.univ-lemans.fr/en/content/ted-lium-corpus) datasets

Training set contains :
* LibriSpeech's train-clean-100
* LibriSpeech's train-clean-360
* LibriSpeech's train-other-500
* Shtooka's eng-balm-emmanuel_flac.tar
* Shtooka's eng-balm-judith_flac.tar
* Shtooka's eng-balm-verbs_flac.tar
* Shtooka's eng-wcp-us_flac.tar
* Shtooka's eng-wims-mary_flac.tar
* TED-LIUM's release 2

Test set contains :
* LibriSpeech's test-clean

### How to try it
Make sure to set those parameters in your config file :

    [acoustic_network_params]
    num_layers : 3
    hidden_size : 768
    dropout_input_keep_prob : 0.8
    dropout_output_keep_prob : 0.5
    batch_size : 10
    learning_rate : 0.0003
    lr_decay_factor : 0.33
    grad_clip : 5
        
    [general]
    use_config_file_if_checkpoint_exists : True
    steps_per_checkpoint : 1000
    checkpoint_dir : trained_models/acoustic_model/english
        
    [training]
    max_input_seq_length : 1800
    max_target_seq_length : 600
    batch_normalization : False
    dataset_size_ordering : False


Run the model on a "less than 15 seconds long" wav file of your choice

    python3 stt.py --file data/LibriSpeech/dev-clean/2086/149220/2086-149220-0007.flac

On this example file from Librispeech dev set that the model never trained on you will obtain :

    it now contained only shon to clar his two wides and a selitary chicken

the original text being :

    it now contained only chanticleer his two wives and a solitary chicken

### Reproduce the learning phase
Put the training data directories in a "train" directory and set it in config file

    training_dataset_dirs : data/Shtooka/train, data/LibriSpeech/train, data/TEDLIUM_release2/train

Put the test data in another directory and set it in config file

    test_dataset_dirs : data/LibriSpeech/test

Launch training and wait...

    python3 stt.py --train --tb_name libri_shoota_TEDLIUM


### Training graphs

The learning rate was initialized at 0.0003 and was lowered when result on the test set did not improve.
A bug prevented it to drop from steps 6.000 to 34.000. Training was stopped and relaunched at 34.000 after the
bug was fixed.

The error rate below is on the test set on which the rnn never train.
Even with 3 layers the CER does not drop below 20 %

The loss is dropping as expected.
